# Pre-commit hook.
# The pre-commit hook will ensure that the following is available for the project:
#
#    - PHP is available for the terminal
#    - Composer.json has been downloaded for the project
#    - Composer is available for the project
#    - Ensure that vendor has been added to the .gitignore
#    - Composer has been run and vendors are available
#
# It then finds all scripts that are in pre-commit-hooks and will execute them
# prior to allowing the user to continue with a commit.
#

# CONFIGURAITON:
# Variables here should be configured per project.
